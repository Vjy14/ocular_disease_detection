# ocular_disease_detection


This project presents a pioneering methodology for the detection of eye diseases, focusing on Glaucoma, Uveitis, Cataract, and normal eye conditions. In contrast to existing approaches that primarily utilize retinal scan images, our team has adopted a unique strategy by leveraging naked eye images, deviating from the conventional use of retinal scans. The absence of pre-existing datasets for the targeted diseases prompted us to curate and construct our own dataset through extensive image collection efforts.The project utilizes a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture, specifically the ResNet model, to extract intricate features from the naked eye images, facilitating accurate classification of the identified eye conditions.The project employs advanced image processing and machine learning techniques to analyze the distinctive features present in naked eye images, enabling accurate classification of the specified eye conditions. The absence of predefined datasets on the internet posed a challenge that our team addressed by diligently assembling a diverse and comprehensive dataset. The selected diseases— Glaucoma, Uveitis, Cataract, and normal eye—represent a spectrum of common ocular conditions, making the project relevant to a broad range of clinical applications.The outcomes of this research demonstrate the feasibility of employing naked eye images for disease detection, offering a potential alternative to the prevalent use of retinal scans. The developed model showcases promising accuracy in classifying different eye conditions, highlighting the significance of our novel dataset creation approach. This project contributes to the evolving field of computer-aided diagnosis in ophthalmology, opening avenues for further exploration and development in the domain of non-invasive eye disease detection..
